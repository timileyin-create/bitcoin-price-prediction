;; BitPredict: Decentralized Bitcoin Price Prediction Market
;;
;; A trustless platform built on Stacks where users can predict 
;; Bitcoin price movements and earn rewards for correct predictions.
;;
;; The contract enables:
;;  - Creating time-locked BTC price prediction markets
;;  - Staking STX on price movement directions (up/down)
;;  - Resolving markets via a trusted oracle
;;  - Distributing rewards to winning participants

;; Error Codes
